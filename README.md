**Welcome to my repository of daily solved LeetCode problems!**                                                                                                                                                             
This collection is a record of my consistent problem-solving journey, where I tackle one or more LeetCode challenges each day.

**Purpose**                                                                                                                                                                                                              
This repository serves multiple purposes:

1.**Practice**: Regular problem-solving to sharpen my coding skills.                                                                                                                                                    
2.**Documentation**: A structured log of all the challenges I've solved, which I can refer back to.                                                                                                                      
3.**Sharing** **Knowledge**: Helping others by sharing my solutions and methodologies.

**Future Plans**                                                                                                                                                                                                        
I plan to keep this repository updated with daily solutions and may also include:

**Alternative Solutions**: Exploring different approaches to the same problem.  
**Complexity Analysis**: Adding time and space complexity analysis to each solution.                                                                                                                                    
**Problem Categories**: Organizing problems by type (e.g., arrays, strings, dynamic programming) in the future.

**Contributions**                                                                                                                                                                                                        
While this is a personal project, I welcome contributions and suggestions. Feel free to open issues or submit pull requests if you have alternative solutions or improvements.
